ENPM 667 final project

# LQR-and-LQG-controller-for-a-moving-crane-with-dual-pendulums

Consider a crane that moves along an one-dimensional track. It behaves
as a frictionless cart with mass M actuated by an external force F that constitutes the input of the system.
There are two loads suspended from cables attached to the crane. The loads have mass m1 and m2, and
the lengths of the cables are l1 and l2, respectively. The following figure depicts the crane and associated
variables used throughout this project.
